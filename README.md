# TDD and Unit Testing
## Unittest and Pytest

### TDD
- What is it?
- How do you implement it?


### Unit Testing
- What is it?
- What are the benefits?
    - Maintainable - update/fix/refractoring
    - Code is more containable
    - Reduce technical debts - using libraries (etc) which are harder to maintain
    - You know when you are done - when the tests pass
    - Sense of direction
    - Tests itself


### Tools / frameworks for Python

#### Unittest
- Unittest comes with python (standard)


#### Pytest
- Pytests needs to be installed as a package
- However, it is pretty and clean
- Will test for file names 'test_^' or '^_test'
